# Project details:
### <span style="color:blue"> Statistics </span> Demonstration for Git
This website is dedicated to my obsession with infographics and statistics. It displays all my public repositories via the GitHub API.

## TODO list
Usually I'd use TargetProcess or something similar to maintain tasks needed to be done but I wan't to keep this project open to the public so others know my plans for the future
- [ ] Add statistics container to the right side of the pie chart
- [ ] Add total commits, avg of commits and other relevant statistics to the right stats container
- [ ] Expand repo displaying statistics and information about that repository
- [ ] Break repository list into 2 seperate columns
- [ ] Implement other service for the prog langs icons
- [ ] Order the repositories by their creation date, in descending order from latest repo to oldest
- [ ] Break the repos into seperate containers by their programming language
- [ ] Add input box for other users' username of github to display their repositories in same style


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
